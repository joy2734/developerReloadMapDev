                    The intent of this guide is to give you an idea about the Android development landscape and to help guide your learning if you are confused. 
                    Before we start, please note that the roadmap is opinionated, and you might have different opinions than those of the author. Having said that, 
                    <a>we would love to hear your opinions</a> and incorporate them in the roadmap if suitable.
                    <br/><br/>
                    There are multiple ways to develop applications for the android; you can go down the path of hybrid application development where <a>flutter</a>,
                    <a>react-native</a>, or <a>NativeScript</a> are the most common contenders. Flutter uses Dart, whereas React Native and Native Script rely on JavaScript.
                      Answering the question of hybrid vs native is out of the scope of this roadmap. This roadmap is focused on the native Android apps development
                       but if you are interested in learning any hybrid framework, my personal preference is <a>react-native</a> and I would recommend you to checkout 
                       the <a>Frontend Developer Roadmap</a>.

                    For the languages, you can develop android apps either by using Kotlin or Java.

                    Although, you can use both Kotlin and Java to develop native android apps, Google announced in 2019 to make Kotlin the preferred way of developing android applications. If you were to start learning android development today, Kotlin should be your language of choice.

                    Version control systems record your changes to the codebase and allow you to recall specific versions later. There are multiple Version Control Systems available but Git is the most common one these days.

                    That wraps it up for the android developer roadmap. Again, remember to not be exhausted by the list; just learn the basics and start working on some project, rest of the learnings will come along the way. Good luck!
